# machinelearning_applications

An introduction of applications in machine learning

Target: Machine learning classes @UET, VNU (Undergraduate)

# Applications in the lecture

- Finding similar users based on their preferences
- Recommending items to a user
- Building “customer viewed this also viewed” item recommendation
- Grouping things that people wants
- Discovering the buying patterns
- Predict gas consumptions
- Predict the quality of white wine
- Detect the wine class

# Algorithms will be found in the lecture:
- Collaborative filtering: uesr-based and item-based
- KNN
- Clustering
  + hierarchical clustering
  + k-means
- Expectation maximization
- Apriori algorithm (for association rule mining)
- Regression
  + Linear regression
  + Support vector regression
- Classification
  + SVM
  + Naive bayes
  + Logistic regression
- Cross validation
- Feature scaling

The code is provided in the jupyter notebook file.

Cheers!
